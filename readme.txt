Hello! 

The aco is set up to run all trials for both BP problems. Just hit run. 

The only dependencies that may need to be installed can be done so: 
"pip install matplotlib numpy tqdm"

to run the Iteration based paramater system version (IBPS) from the further experiment, 
just set run_aco_with_IBPS = True. 

The code will make a folder with simple bar graphs that show the results. 
It will also store the results in a json file in another folder. 

Separate folders and graphs for the coursework implementation and further experiment version are made.
